ShoppingList++
========

ShoppingList++ is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Firebase Essentials : Build a Shopping List App](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-essentials-for-android--ud009). 

The course covers everything you need to know to incorporate the [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) into an Android App.

For an explanation of how to use this repository, please refer to the [Using ShoppingList++ Github Repository document](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud009/navigategithubrepo?nocache) and [The Github Code & Resources document](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud009/l-5389267455/e-5498429638/m-5528878616).

##Seeing Errors?

![Conflict errors](http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zQxJRMJIEnWEQb7csOy3AiJoIJiOnY_dqf4D-seEEpJQFBMwmdpCF_JeszhB96K57tFxW2_FtOQvmIhUvQ=s0#w=1014&h=359)

As mistakes in the original repository are fixed, the code will be <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing" target="_blank">rebased</a> and re-uploaded here. The good news is if students discover errors or optimizations, the code will be updated. The unfortunate side effect is that this will destroy Github forks and stars as well as require the code to be re-downloaded to get the newest updates. So my humble suggestion is to **NOT** fork or star this repository. Instead, you can bookmark this page. If you are not checking out branches and instead making the app the **thorough way** you can check out the change log to see what was fixed. If you're working through the **fast way** you can re-clone the repository.
